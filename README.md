#FFTs, PDEs, and Useful Computer stuff

Originally this repo was a series of Python scripts to plot 
some common Fourier series and the time evolution of a 
simple diffusion equation (along with some notes on derivations). The 
remit is expanding to include basic concepts in Python scripting and 
general linux/mac os configuration scripts. It could be considered 
the very early material for an introductory computing course but really
is just a repo of useful reference materials.
